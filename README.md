# Snowflake Data Loading & Transformation Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data loading and transformation workflow** in **Snowflake**.  
It uses two related datasets (`customers` & `orders`) to simulate a small retail database.  
The project covers:
- Creating databases, schemas, and tables
- Staging files in **Snowflake Internal Stage**
- Bulk loading data using `COPY INTO`
- Performing **JOIN operations** and creating transformed tables
- Validating data accuracy
